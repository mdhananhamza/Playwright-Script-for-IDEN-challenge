This script automates the extraction of product data from an application using playwright. It handles login, navigates through a nested menu, scrolls to load all product tables, and exports the extracted data to a  json file.


The Features of this Script are:

Session Handling – Reuses an existing session if available, otherwise logs in with provided credentials.
Automated Navigation – Clicks through the menu to access the Product Catalog.
Dynamic Scrolling – Scrolls directly to the bottom to load all product tables efficiently.
Data Extraction – Collects product details  from all tables.
JSON Export – Saves extracted data in products.json.
